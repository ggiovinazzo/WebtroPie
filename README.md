WebtroPie is a light weight web application hosted on a raspberry pi [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk) system to help manage and browse games, metadata and media.

It can be used by any device running a modern web browser in your home or remote network without a need to install any additional files on the device.

WebtroPie uses the themes installed on your pi to show systems and gamelists similarly to EmulationStation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gazpan/WebtroPie
cd WebtroPie
sudo ./INSTALL.sh
```
